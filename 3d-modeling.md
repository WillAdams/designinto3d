# 3D Modeling

Since CAD programs were first created, there have been a number of different approaches. The most common ones, and example implementations may be:

* Mechanical modeling --- Alibre Atom 3D&#x20;
* Mesh sculpting --- Blender
* NURBS --- Plasticity 3D

This page will consider these three programs and ways in which they might be used.
