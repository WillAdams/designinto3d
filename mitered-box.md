The simplest way to cut a box shape is to use a suitable sheet good and simply cut miters into it --- modern adhesives are able to make this a strong joint and most CAM tools allow for it to be drawn up and modeled with just a few lines.

As with all boxes, they are defined by their height, width, and depth, with the stock thickness determining the interior dimensions and the specifics of joinery.
