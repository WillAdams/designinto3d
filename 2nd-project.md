# 2nd Project

Removing one or more shapes from one piece of wood, and the negative of that shape from another is the basis of wood joinery techniques. Traditional wood joinery often takes advantage of the sharp internal geometries which are possible with saws and chisels, but working with a router in a CNC requires us to take into consideration the rounded cut which an endmill will make if it does not cut past the edge of a part.
