# Prototypes and Designs

As noted, designs are either boxes or platforms. Creating a template for a basic box design will allow the development of features and capabilities which may then be used for specific designs. Setup is straight-forward: variable for parameters and some modules for the parts:

Then it is simply a matter of setting up the logic for making either a DXF or a 3D preview and positioning \(and if need be rotating\) the parts for the appropriate view. For the flat \(DXF\) plan view:

Or for the 3D Preview:
