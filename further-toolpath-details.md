# Further Toolpath Details

Once a part has been designed, as noted previously, it is necessary to cut it out. The implication here is obvious, rather than designing the part, what is actually needed is the toolpath which guides the endmill around and/or over and/or through the part so as to result in the specified shape.

As noted before, the best practice is to design the part in the orientation which is best suited to cutting â€• it may then be rotated and/or moved into position. A further consideration is that the parts should be arranged relative to a block which represents the stock.
