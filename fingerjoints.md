# Fingerjoints

Starting with the box design template from the previous chapter: [https://www.blockscad3d.com/community/projects/965700](https://www.blockscad3d.com/community/projects/965700) it is a simple matter of adding cuts for joinery along the edges. Fingerjoints are notable since they can be implemented along all edges of a box and with a bit of a relief can be cut flat on the machine simplifying fixturing and making manufacture more efficient.

The interplay of the geometry of the board being flat and the cutter being round requires certain options and accommodations in the module for cutting the joints. It is necessary to specify:

* Endmill Diameter
* Whether the cut should be adjusted for endmill diameter
* Whether the cut should be relieved for endmill diameter
* If the cut should be adjusted at its beginning or end for the thickness of the material
