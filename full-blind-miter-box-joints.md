# Full Blind Miter Box Joints

Adding a third tool, a large V endmill, and using it to cut a full blind miter joint at the end of the joints simplifies the geometry quite a bit, and with modern adhesives, still allows for a very strong joint. Layout is much the same, only simpler, as is the geometry and alignments, which are all more forgiving.

One concern with doing this is that the thickness to which even a 1/2" tool will cut is strictly limited, being of course equal to half the diameter:
