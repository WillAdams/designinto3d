# Blind Miter & Hidden Spline

While modern adhesives are surprisingly able to allow one to simply cut and glue miters \(esp. if one is willing to add a few nails\), adding a hidden spline will create a much stronger joint \(and one which has the added benefit of being self-aligning\). 

The miter itself is of course simply a bisecting of the junction of the two boards:

In order to cut the miter and the void for the spline a V endmill which is narrower in diameter than the boards are in thickness will be necessary:

In order to leave a reasonable amount of material, the endmill should cut so that it is positioned closer to the interior than the exterior of the box â€• making the cuts for the spline equal in width to one-half the board thickness and positioning them one-eighth the board thickness in from the interior edge results in a reasonable arrangement which is easily calculated:
