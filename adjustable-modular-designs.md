# Adjustable Modular Designs

The ideal joint would be void free and not show any endgrain, while being self-aligning and offering sufficient long-grain glue surface for strength --- the classic example of this is the blind miter dovetail which is pretty much the exclusive domain of hand tool woodworking.

A similar design would be the blind miter box or fingerjoint which has seen a number of implementations:

As the latter two links make clear, there are two possible approaches: 

* Use the radius of the endmill to define the fingers so as to minimize endgrain--endgrain connections
* Overcut with dogbones which makes the layout simpler

The former can become quite complex and requires over-cutting which creates voids, while the latter has voids designed in.
