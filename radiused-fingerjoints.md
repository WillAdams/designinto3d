# Radiused Fingerjoints

There are many examples of cutting fingerjoints with dogbones to allow for the radius on an endmill, which works, but results in a visible void in the project. An alternative approach is to cut the fingerjoints and then use a cove radius endmill to round off the fingers as necessary allowing for a joint which does not have visible voids. For discussion see: [https://community.carbide3d.com/t/design-into-3d-boxes-magazine-storage/16238](https://community.carbide3d.com/t/design-into-3d-boxes-magazine-storage/16238)

Interestingly, it is possible to take a file intended for lasercutting and simply add some lines for the radiusing and then cut out the box \(if one is willing to forgo an accurate 3D preview of the cut\). Since this affords an expedient approach which allows approaching the project in a straight-forward fashion which can be built on to understand the approach, this will be shown first.
