# Machine Operation

Ideally everything for operating a machine would be covered at: [https://my.carbide3d.com/](https://my.carbide3d.com/) as well as: [https://shapeokoenthusiasts.gitbook.io/shapeoko-cnc-a-to-z/](https://shapeokoenthusiasts.gitbook.io/shapeoko-cnc-a-to-z/) with the specifics of Carbide Create covered in [2D Drawing](2d-drawing.md), [Toolpaths](toolpaths.md), and (for folks with Pro licenses) [3D Modeling from 2D Geometry](3d-modeling-from-2d-geometry.md), and Carbide Motion covered in [Machine Motion](machine-motion.md). This chapter will function as an overview of the entire process of making a part or project.
