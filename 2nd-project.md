# 2nd Project

Removing one or more shapes from one piece of wood, and the negative of that shape from another is the basis of wood joinery techniques. Traditional wood joinery often takes advantage of the sharp internal geometries which are possible with saws and chisels, but working with a router in a CNC requires us to take into consideration the rounded cut which an endmill will make if it does not cut past the edge of a part.

The first machined joint which took into account the use of round tools to join parts was the Knapp joint: [https://furnishgreen.com/fun-furniture-fact-the-knapp-joint/](https://furnishgreen.com/fun-furniture-fact-the-knapp-joint/). See: [https://community.carbide3d.com/t/knapp-joint-with-cnc/19723](https://community.carbide3d.com/t/knapp-joint-with-cnc/19723) for further details and an example file. The problem with it and similar and traditional joints \(finger joints, dovetails\) is that they require a CNC which will allow for a fixture for holding boards on end when cutting such as: [https://cutrocket.com/p/5cb25f3380844/](https://cutrocket.com/p/5cb25f3380844/) and will at the least require 2 setups \(clamp all four boards at once, cut one set of corner joints, repeat for opposite ends\) in addition to cutting boards to length and machining any features which one might need.

An alternative technique would be to lay the stock out flat and machine the edges so that things are not merely cut to size, but also have any necessary features cut in place and geometry along the edges which will allow parts to fit together. Finger joints are popular for this, and can be cut on a CNC if one finds the semicircular voids which are the result of cutting dogbones and similar features where necessary.
